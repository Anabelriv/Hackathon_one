            School Types in Israel
        </h1>
        <p>Trom-Trom Chova: Pre-school for three-year olds <br>
    Trom-Chova: Pre-school for four-year olds <br>
    Gan Chova: Kindergarten for five-year olds<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the United States, children enter “school” when they go to Kindergarten. Here, Kindergarten is part of the pre-school system. In Israel, when people talk about Gan, they include Kindergarten. When they say “going to school” they are referring to first grade. <br>
    
    Placement into each of these pre-school programs is based on the child's date of birth. Registration for school and Gan in Israel is determined by the child's Gregorian birthday. Entrance to each school year is from January 1st until December 31st. Children that are turning three by January 1st, begin the Trom-Trom Chova program in September, when they are only a little more than two and a half.<br>
    
    While the formal registration process is determined by your child's birthday, the actual age division in the Gan varies by city and sometimes within cities, by the Gan. In some cities, the three and four-year-old programs are mixed in one Gan, while in others they are usually separate. Kindergarten is a separate program, but often children that are in the last six months of the four-year-old registration period are placed in Kindergarten and then repeat Kindergarten the next year. Once you choose the specific city you are moving to, ask your neighbors how the Gan is set up in terms of age requirements. You may need this information to help determine what Gan you wish your child to attend. <br>

        Mamlachti Dati (religious Zionist public) - Modern orthodox day schools best align with these programs, which include a wide range of religious observances, including Torani (Torah-oriented) or Chardal (Chareidi Dati Leumi) schools with enhanced Torah studies.

        Homeschooling is finally legal in Israel. Officially, for each child you need permission from the Ministry of Education. Many families are currently homeschooling without such permission, and have not been forced to send their children to school. How much they have been hassled has varied from case to case. Many have had no problems at all.
